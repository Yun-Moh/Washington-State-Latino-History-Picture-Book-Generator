The State We’re In: Latino History in Washington. 
Civics is about who makes the rules. When you’re a kid, your parents make the rules, your teachers make the rules. Once you grow up, you get to make the rules... studying civics is how you learn how to be a good rule-maker.

Introduction: What’s in a name? It’s complicated.
There are several terms to describe people from Latin America and the Caribbean. Indigenous is a word for people who have lived in a place for thousands of years. Places conquered by Spain became countries where Spanish was the national language.
For a long time, most people from Spanish-language Latin America preferred to be called Hispanic. In the 1960s, Mexican Americans in the civil rights movement called themselves Chicanos. 
By the early 21st century, people used Latino/Latina. Some use Latinx or Latine for gender neutrality.

Who were the first Latinos in Washington?
Explorers from Spain, arriving in the 1770s, were the first non-Natives to visit the Washington coast. Spanish was the first non-native language spoken here.
Washington’s first transportation system: Mexicans with mule teams. During the 1800s, Mexican muleteers managed teams transporting shipments from mines and farms.

1848: The Mexican border moved south.
In 1848 the US won a war with Mexico and took 55% of its land (CA, NV, UT, NM, AZ, CO). People living there became Americans overnight.

Irrigation brings immigration.
Starting in the early 1900s, irrigation meant more farmland, which required workers. Migrant workers traveled state to state.
Latino population in WA: 1980 (120,016) -> 2020 (1,022,667).

What farmworkers do.
It is hard physical labor. Picking fruit without bruising, cutting asparagus. Risks include falls, chemicals, extreme heat. 
Farm work is important in Central/Eastern WA (grains, fruit, veg) and West side (berries, tulips, dairy).
Many Latinos also work in forests replanting trees or picking mushrooms.

Phyllis Gutiérrez Kenney.
Retired WA State Representative. Born in 1936 to migrant family ("sugar beet baby"). Family settled in Wapato. Helped establish farmworker clinics. Elected to legislature 1997-2012. Passed laws for bilingual job skills and financial aid for undocumented students.

Latinos in Washington towns and cities.
Mike Sotelo: Rose from laborer to chair of WA Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
Gene Juarez: Son of farmworkers, opened high-end salons.
Alfie Alvarado-Ramos: Director, WA Dept of Veterans Affairs.
Chief Justice Steven C. González: WA Supreme Court.
Challenges: Prejudice (Mike Sotelo called "lettuce picker"), professional licenses not recognized for doctors from other countries.

Farmworkers struggle with low pay.
Low wages due to history of cheap labor/slavery and consumer demand for cheap food.
Unions: Workers try to form unions for better pay. 1909 IWW attempt in Yakima. Cesar Chavez and UFW in 1960s.
Current unions: Familias Unidas por la Justicia (FUPJ) won contracts with Sakuma Brothers Farms and improvements at Washington Bulb Company (tulips).

Race, changing times, and hardship.
1920s: Latinos recruited. 1929 Depression: Latinos deported (even citizens) to make jobs for Whites.
1940s WWII: Bracero Program recruited Mexicans to work farms and railroads while Americans went to war. Bad conditions, but essential work.

The civil rights movement.
1960s: Inspired by Black civil rights movement. 
University of Washington students started a movement. 
El Centro de la Raza: Founded by Roberto Maestas. Occupied an empty school in Seattle in 1972 for 3 months until city agreed to lease it. Now a major community center.
Sea Mar Community Health Centers: Founded by Rogelio Riojas (student leader). Started in 1978. Now 60 clinics.
Radio KDNA: Started 1979 in Yakima. "La voz del campesino". Vital for information (Mt St Helens, COVID).

Education reform.
Before 1960s, no bilingual programs. Migrant kids moved constantly, losing credits.
Now bilingual programs exist.
Community education: Latinx Youth Summit, Mi Chiantla (STEM/Arts in Thurston County).

Latino Leadership.
Many legislators today. 
Rep. Alex Ybarra: Math whiz, scientist, school board president, state representative.
Carolina Mejia: Immigrant from Honduras, elected Thurston County Commissioner in 2021.

Changing patterns.
Majority Mexican heritage, but growing diversity (Central America, Caribbean).
"Push and Pull" factors. Violence/poverty in Northern Triangle (Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala) pushes people out.
